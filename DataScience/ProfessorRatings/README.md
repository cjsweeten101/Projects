The goal of this project was to scrape some professor data off of ratemyprofessors.com.  Transform the data into a more 
usable form, then look at any interesting correlations/trends.

The scraping was done using the Requests/BeautifulSoup python libraries.  The visualization was done with matplotlib and 
seaborn.  

The project is split into two jupyter notebooks, the first doing the scraping and basic cleaning, and the second doing the 
visualization.
